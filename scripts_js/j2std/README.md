# Journal-to-Standard

This script transforms my standard personal journal format (that I've been using
for a long time), and transforms it into my custom XML format. My journal used
to be done with simple markdown syntax, and the date was written before anything
else. This format became limited as it grew to hundreds of entries, so I've
moved to my unified XML format to be able to parse the dates programmatically.

It works with the DTD located in
[Doctype](https://github.com/matt-goncalves/doctype/blob/main/dtd/document.dtd).
